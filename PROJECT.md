# Authentication and Authorization

## Features

### Registration
- Collect essential details: username, email, password.
- Password hashing: Use libraries like bcrypt to securely hash passwords before storing.
- Email verification: Send a link/token to the user's email to verify.

### Login
- Basic email/username and password login.
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
- Refresh token mechanism to renew the JWT without having the user log in again.

### Logout
- Invalidate JWTs or sessions.
- If using refresh tokens, invalidate them as well.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define user roles: e.g., Admin, Regular User, Guest.
- Implement middleware functions in Express.js that check a user's role before granting access to specific routes.

### Profile Management
- Allow users to view and edit their profile.
- Change password functionality.

### Password Reset
- "Forgot Password" functionality: Send a reset link or token to the user's email.
- Allow users to set a new password using the link/token.

### Account Locking
- Lock a user's account after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts.
- Automatic unlock after a specific time or send an unlock link to the user's email

### Activity Logs
- Keep a log of when a user logs in, logs out, changes the password, etc.
- This can help in debugging as well as provide an audit trail


## Technical Implementation

### Framework
- Express.js with TypeScript

### Database
- PostgreSQL (or MySQL) with Prisma as ORM.
  - Tables for users, roles, activity logs, etc

### Authentication
- Use JWT for stateless authentication
- Libraries: jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, etc

### Email Service
- For sending verification, password reset emails
- Use services like nodemailer for development. For production, consider SendGrid or Mailgun.

### Rate Limiting
- To prevent brute-force attacks, use libraries like express-rate-limit.


## Learning Outcomes

- Understand how to securely handle and store user data.
- Grasp the principles of JWT-based authentication and session management.
- Experience with integrating third-party services, such as email providers.
- Implement and understand the importance of role-based access control.
- Build robust security measures like rate limiting and account locking.

### To start:

- Set up your Express.js project with TypeScript.
- Integrate Prisma and design your database schema for the user table.
- Build the registration and login routes, making sure passwords are hashed.
- Implement JWT for user sessions.
- Add the email verification system.
- Continue adding the other features progressively.
- As you build, always consider the security implications of your decisions and ensure that user data is handled with care.
